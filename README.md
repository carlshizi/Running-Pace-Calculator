# Running Pace Calculator EXTREME
With this calculator, you can create a race, add splits (split up your race and have different pace at different split points). You can redo and undo any action. You can output the current Miles/Hour stats. This was just a quick app I worked on. I might eventually add an interface with JavaFX.
